3. **Claim** - Added providerAddress, providerWallet, medicalReportCid, payoutTxHash
4. **KYCDocument** - New model for KYC tracking
5. **Payment** - New model for payment tracking (foundation for future use)

**New Services Created:**

### Phase 3: Frontend (70% Complete)

**New Components Created:**
- ✅ `/frontend/src/hooks/useWallet.js` - Complete MetaMask integration hook
  - Connect/disconnect wallet
  - Network switching to Hardhat
  - Account balance fetching
  - Auto-reconnect on page load
  - Event listeners for account/network changes

- ✅ `/frontend/src/components/WalletConnect.jsx` - Wallet UI component
  - Connection status display
  - Network validation
  - MetaMask installation check
  - Balance display

**New Pages Created:**
- ✅ `/frontend/src/pages/InsurerProviderApprovals.jsx` 
  - List pending providers
  - Approve/reject with on-chain calls
  - View license documents
  - Real-time polling

- ✅ `/frontend/src/pages/InsurerPolicyApprovals.jsx`
  - List pending policies
  - Display escrow premiums
  - Approve (releases escrow) / Reject (refunds)
  - KYC document viewing

**Pages Requiring Updates (Not Completed):**
- ⏸️ PatientDashboard.jsx - Needs wallet integration + KYC upload
- ⏸️ IssuePolicy.jsx - Needs payment flow with MetaMask
- ⏸️ BuyPolicy.jsx - New page for patient policy purchase
- ⏸️ ProviderOnboard.jsx - Needs approval status display

## 🚧 What Needs Manual Intervention

### Critical - Required Before Testing

1. **Deploy Updated Contracts**
   ```bash
   # Start Hardhat node (if not running)
   npx hardhat node
   
   # In another terminal, deploy
   npx hardhat run contracts/scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```
   **Expected Output:** New contract addresses in `/deployments/deployed.json`

2. **Update Frontend Contract Addresses**
   - Need to update contract addresses in frontend code
   - Typically in a config file or constants
   - **TODO:** Identify where addresses are loaded in frontend

3. **Update Backend Contract Addresses**
   - Backend contract-service.js may need new addresses
   - Check `/backend/contract-service.js` and update from deployed.json

### Important - For Full Functionality

4. **Frontend Page Updates**
   - Integrate WalletConnect component into existing pages
   - Add MetaMask transaction calls for:
     - Policy purchase with premium payment
     - Claim approval with ETH transfer
   - Update UI to show approval statuses

5. **Router Configuration**
   - Add routes for InsurerProviderApprovals and InsurerPolicyApprovals
   - Ensure navigation links exist

6. **MetaMask Browser Testing**
   - Can only be tested in actual browser with MetaMask installed
   - Need to import Hardhat test accounts
   - Test actual ETH transactions

---

## 🤔 Assumptions Made

### Technical Assumptions
1. **OpenZeppelin Version:** Used v5.x (latest) with updated import paths
2. **Hardhat Network:** Assumed Chain ID 31337 (0x7A69)
3. **Test Accounts:** Used Hardhat's default test accounts
4. **Insurer Address:** Assumed deployer (Account #0) is insurer
5. **CommonJS vs ESM:** Backend uses ESM (import/export)
6. **Database:** Existing data compatible with new schema via defaults

### Business Logic Assumptions
1. **Premium Rates:** 
   - Basic: 1% of coverage
   - Standard: 2% of coverage  
   - Premium: 3% of coverage
2. **Approval Authority:** Single insurer address (no multi-sig)
3. **Refund Mechanism:** Automatic on rejection (no manual refund)
4. **Provider Payment:** Direct to provider wallet (no intermediary)
5. **KYC Verification:** Manual insurer review (no automated checking)

### Data Model Assumptions
1. **Legacy Compatibility:** Kept fileCid in Claim for backward compatibility
2. **String Storage:** Amounts stored as strings to avoid precision loss
3. **Status Strings:** Used string statuses (not enums) in database
4. **Default Values:** Made new required fields have defaults for migration
